This is a Java port of Ozan Yigit's SDBM by Justin F. Chapweske.

The Java interface that I chose for Sdbm is sort of a marriage between
RandomAccessFile and Hashtable and should be quite simple to use in your
software.

The software probably has the most utility when used to create indexes for 
caches as it is quite fast for but put and get operations.

This software is a part of the SoLinger Java Protocols Project at 
http://solinger.sourceforge.net/

attention conservation notice: I have not tried to build this recently.
If there are any build issues, let me know, or give me a PR. -- oz
